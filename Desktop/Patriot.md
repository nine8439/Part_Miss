<h2>Patriot Missile System Background</h2>
1. The MIM-104 Patriot is a surface-to-air missile (SAM) system, the primary of its kind used by the United States Army and several allied nations. It is manufactured by the U.S. defense contractor Raytheon and derives its name from the radar component of the weapon system.

2. The AN/MPQ-53 at the heart of the system is known as the "Phased array Tracking Radar to Intercept on Target" or the bacronym PATRIOT.

3. Patriot uses an advanced aerial interceptor missile and high-performance radar systems.

4. It's initial purpose was as an anti-aircraft system, but it quickly became used as  anti-tactile ballistic missiles. 

5. The Patriot Missile system consists of an advanced radar system and an anti-ballistic missile.

6. The Patriot system has four major operational functions: communications, command and control, radar surveillance, and missile guidance. The four functions combine to provide a coordinated, secure, integrated, mobile air defense system.

<h2>Patriot Missile System Technology</h2>

1. The AN/MPQ-53/65 Radar Set is a passive electronically scanned array radar equipped with IFF, electronic counter-countermeasure (ECCM), and track-via-missile (TVM) guidance subsystems. The beam created by the Patriot's flat phased array radar is comparatively narrow and highly agile compared to a moving dish. This characteristic gives the radar the ability to detect small, fast targets like ballistic missiles, or low radar cross section targets such as stealth aircraft or cruise missiles.

2. AN/MSQ-104 engagement control station consists of: Weapons control computer (WCC) - The computer of the patriot missile systems, Data Link Terminal – The interface to the missile launchers, UHF communications array – Creates the medium for network communications between the patriot missile systems, LRIU (Routing Logic Radio Interface Unit) – Router for all the data traffic of the patriot system, Two computer manstations  - stations where humans (operators) interface with the system

Also Important: It is contained in a mobile shelter capable of withstanding  Electromagnetic Interference, chemical/biological attacks, and also acts as protection against the elements.
