<h2>Patriot Missile System Background</h2>
1. The MIM-104 Patriot is a surface-to-air missile (SAM) system, the primary of its kind used by the United States Army and several allied nations. It is manufactured by the U.S. defense contractor Raytheon and derives its name from the radar component of the weapon system.

2. The AN/MPQ-53 at the heart of the system is known as the "Phased array Tracking Radar to Intercept on Target" or the bacronym PATRIOT.

3. Patriot uses an advanced aerial interceptor missile and high-performance radar systems.

4. It's initial purpose was as an anti-aircraft system, but it quickly became used as  anti-tactile ballistic missiles. 

5. The Patriot Missile system consists of an advanced radar system and an anti-ballistic missile.

6. The Patriot system has four major operational functions: communications, command and control, radar surveillance, and missile guidance. The four functions combine to provide a coordinated, secure, integrated, mobile air defense system.

<h2>Patriot Missile System Technology</h2>

1. The AN/MPQ-53/65 Radar Set is a passive electronically scanned array radar equipped with IFF, electronic counter-countermeasure (ECCM), and track-via-missile (TVM) guidance subsystems. The beam created by the Patriot's flat phased array radar is comparatively narrow and highly agile compared to a moving dish. This characteristic gives the radar the ability to detect small, fast targets like ballistic missiles, or low radar cross section targets such as stealth aircraft or cruise missiles.

2. AN/MSQ-104 engagement control station consists of: 
    1. Weapons control computer (WCC) - The computer of the patriot missile systems 
    2. Data Link Terminal – The interface to the missile launchers  
    3. UHF communications array – Creates the medium for network communications between the patriot missile systems 
    4. LRIU (Routing Logic Radio Interface Unit) – Router for all the data traffic of the patriot system 
    5. Two computer manstations  - stations where humans (operators) interface with the system

Also Important: It is contained in a mobile shelter capable of withstanding  Electromagnetic Interference, chemical/biological attacks, and also acts as protection against the elements.

3. OE-349 Antenna Mast Group, consists of mobile platform, and 4 antennas in two pairs with it's associated amplifiers and radios
Important: This creates the communications network for the system

4. M901 Launching Station: station where the missile is launched, self-contained.

<h2>Patriot Missile Technology</h2>

1. MIM-104A – solely for anti-aircraft purpose

2. MIM104C/D/E (PAC-2) - for anti-missile; intended to explode on engagement; consists of four sections
    1. Propulsion section
    2. Warhead section
    3. Guidance section – Consists of the auto-guidance systems and also the Track via guidance System (from ground control)
    4. Control actuator section – controls the fins of the missile for stability and steering

<h2>Use and Disaster in the Gulf War</h2>

+ The Persian Gulf War was the first usage of the Patriot missile system to shoot down ballistic missiles as opposed to only aircraft.

+ It was used 40 times to shoot down missiles, primarily Scud or Al Hussein short range ballistic missiles.

+ The initial launch was actually a computer glitch

+ The worst failure was when an army barracks in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia was hit by a Scud missile and 28 people died.

+ On the night of the 25th of February, 1991, a Patriot missile system operating in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, failed to track and intercept an incoming Scud. The Iraqi missile impacted into an army barracks, killing 28 U.S. soldiers and injuring another 98.

+ The cause of the missile system failing to defend against the incoming Scud was traced back to a bug in Patriot's radar and tracking software

<h2>Overview of Disaster</h2>

+ Problem Statement: “System failed to identify a  enemy missile after the system had been running continuously for over 100 hours”

+ If we assume the Patriot Missile Systems was correctly working on the European War front prior to the Persian Gulf War, then these problems can be considered as requirements creep.

+ 4 areas where problems were encountered:
    1. Domain/Environment Change
    2. Software: clock drift/round-off error, reboot time, software delivery time, software upgrade time
    3. Hardware: No recorder, difference in ballistic missiles versus Aircraft/Cruise Missiles
    4. User Ware: no auditory alarms, information on Operation doctorine
